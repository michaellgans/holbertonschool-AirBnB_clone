**Hello!** :wave: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for taking interest in our AirB&B project.  This is the first part of a multi-week partner project where my partner Kasper and I will recreate the layers of a replica of the AirB&B website.  In this ReadMe, we'll review the parts of the project as a whole, then dive into the current project itself. <br>

**Any comments or feedback is greatly appreciated!** <br>

## AirB&B - Looking Ahead

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AirB&B website allows users to either list properties they would like to host on the website, or browse properties they would like to rent for a vacation!  The overarching project is broken down into six layers: <br>

<details><summary>The Console</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to create a storage engine which will allow us to save and reload objects created. Because of this, multiple objects can be created inside the command interpreter and saved for later use once the RestAPI is created.<br>
- Creates a data model.
- Manages objects by interacting with the console, a command line interpereter.
  - Create objects
  - Update objects
  - Display objects
  - Destroy objects
- Saves objects to a JSON file.</details>

<details><summary>Web Static</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step is to create the static website or application.  In this step, we'll learn both HTML and CSS, as well as how to create multiple objects on the webpage.<br>
- Learning Objectvies
  - HTML/CSS
  - Create the HTML of your application.
  - Create the template of each object.</details>

<details><summary>MySQL Storage</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third step is to upgrade our storage engine by replacing it with a fully functioning database system.<br>
- Learning Objectvies
  - SQL/MySQL
  - Design and create a database for storage.
  - Map our models to a table in the database using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).</details>

<details><summary>Web Framework - Templating</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth step is to create a webserver using Python and Flask.  This will link the storage engine and the static website.<br>
- Learning Objectvies
  - Understand how to use Flask.
  - Create our first web server in Python.</details>

<details><summary>RESTful API</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth step is to expose the objects stored in a JSON web interface.<br>
- Learning Objectvies
  - What is an API?
  - Link JSON web interface to the database.
  - Manipulate objects via RESTful API and Flask.</details>

<details><summary>Web Dynamic</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title Goes Here<br>
- Learning Objectvies
  - HTML/CSS
  - Create the HTML of your application.
  - Create the template of each object.</details>
