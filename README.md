**Hello!** :wave: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for taking interest in our AirB&B project.  This is the first part of a multi-week partner project where my partner Kasper and I will recreate the layers of a replica of the AirB&B website.  In this ReadMe, we'll review the parts of the project as a whole, then dive into the current project itself. <br>

**Any comments or feedback is greatly appreciated!** <br>
